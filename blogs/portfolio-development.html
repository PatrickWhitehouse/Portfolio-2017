                <h1>Portfolio Development</h1>
                <h2>What is Gulp and why did I choose to include it?</h2>
                <p>In this blog post, I’ll be explaining the reasoning behind my choices of layout, colours and fonts used within this website. Not only will I be explaining the aesthetics of the website, I’ll also be exploring into the back end of the site and introducing the tools I used along the way which may or may not have helped me speed up the process of achieving my goal of creating a professional portfolio.</p>
                <h3>Research</h3>
                  <p>I have never been fond of the research stage, however, I’ve learnt how important it is in order to develop a website! Nonetheless, for the creation of my portfolio it was a vital necessity that I carried out a portion of research in order to help guide myself through the design and build stages. </p>
                  <p>The first step I had taken to achieve my goal was to look at common features of other portfolios. For this, I used <a href="http://www.awwwards.com" title="External link to awwwards">awwwards</a>. The reason I had chosen <a href="http://www.awwwards.com" title="External link to awwwards">awwwards</a> as my main source of research was because all of the websites listed within the directory have been nominated or have been given a web award of some sort. This gave me the confidence that the authors and creators of the listed websites knew what they were doing in terms of design. From here I took simple notes of layouts, colour schemes and typography which I found attractive.</p>
                  <figure class="screenshot">
                    <img src="../img/awwwards.jpg" alt="Awwwards homepage" class="screenshot__img">
                    <figcaption class="screenshot__caption">Awwwards homepage</figcaption>
                  </figure>
                  <h3>Design</h3>
                  <p>
                      For the design stage, I used a variety of methods. Firstly, I created sketches with a piece of paper and pencil. The sketching step allowed me to quickly draft ideas regardless of my drawing abilities. I tried to incorporate my layout research into my sketches in order to make it clear to myself what was achievable and realistic.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      After I had come up with a few simplistic designs on paper, I then moved onto turning them into a bunch of electronic wireframes using <a href="http://www.sketchapp.com" title="View the official Sketch app homepage">Sketch</a>, a design application for Mac. I found <a href="http://www.sketchapp.com" title="View the official Sketch app homepage">Sketch</a> the best option as I could pick from defualt template art boards, which are already built into the application upon installation; to help imitate different screen resolutions and device layouts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Based on my research I was able to implement my colour scheme and typography into the wireframes inside of <a href="http://www.sketchapp.com" title="View the official Sketch app homepage">Sketch</a>. <a href="http://www.sketchapp.com" title="View the official Sketch app homepage">Sketch</a> allows full flexibility of fonts and allowed myself to edit multiple elements of the font face such as the font weight, letter spacing, line height and text decoration.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Development</h3>
                  <p>
                      I decided to use HTML and CSS to give the website a structure and some styling. I also used a small amount of Javascript to add functionality. Alongside these, I decided to use SASS as a pre-processor for CSS. The reason behind this was that SASS allowed me to create variables and mixins which meant I could reuse a block of code without having to go through the pain of retyping it every time it was needed.</p>

                        <img src="../img/sass_example.jpg" alt="Example of how SASS is used" class="screenshot__img">
                        <figcaption class="screenshot__caption">Example of how SASS is used</figcaption>
                      </figure>
                      <p>
                          Other than languages, I found <a href="http://gulpjs.com/" title="Official Gulp homepage">Gulp</a> and <a href="https://github.com/" title="GitHub official homepage">GitHub</a> extremely useful whilst I was developing. <a href="https://github.com/" title="GitHub official homepage">Git</a> allowed me to constantly log my changes and revert back to an older version if something went wrong. My main use of <a href="http://gulpjs.com/" title="Official Gulp homepage">Gulp</a> was that it allowed me to automate the conversion of SCSS (SASS) files to CSS.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                          I also used <a href="http://gulpjs.com/" title="Official Gulp homepage">Gulp</a> for other features such as <a href="https://www.browsersync.io/" title="Browsersync homepage">Browsersync</a>. <a href="https://www.browsersync.io/" title="Browsersync homepage">Browsersync</a> allowed me to create a localhost server and enabled me to view my website on different devices simultaneously without having to upload it to a web server every time there was a change. This helped speed up my responsive development immensely as I could edit the webpage and style sheet live thus meaning it would update instantly on the device I was viewing it on. I would recommend <a href="https://www.browsersync.io/" title="Browsersync homepage">Browsersync</a> to every front end developer out there who isn't using it already! You'll see how amazing and practical it is.</p>

                            <img src="../img/gulp_example.jpg" alt="Example of how Gulp is used" class="screenshot__img">
                            <figcaption class="screenshot__caption">My current Gulp file with Browsersync set up</figcaption>
                          </figure>
