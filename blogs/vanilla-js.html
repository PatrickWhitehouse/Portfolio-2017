                <h1>Vanilla JavaScript</h1>
                <h2>Self initiated project</h2>
                <h3>Aims and Objectives</h3>
                <p>The aim of this project was to understand how difficult it would be to create animations using pure Vanilla JavaScript rather than depending on JavaScript libraries such as <a href="https://jquery.com">jQuery</a>.</p>

                <h3>Definition</h3>
                <p>Almost all browsers come with JavaScript enabled in them which means all the browser must do is load and run the JavaScript file that the user creates. Libraries such as jQuery must be linked either by downloading the jQuery file and including that in a folder within the directory, or through using a CDN (content delivery network). Although the syntax for jQuery is shorter and tends to be easier to understand than Vanilla JavaScript, having to depend on external files could decrease site performance speeds. Is there any need in requiring the user to download the whole jQuery library just to create a fade in animation which can be done just as easily in Vanilla JavaScript? With recent features, such as CSS animations, simple effects can be achieved without the need of any JavaScript. 
</p>
                

                <h3>Setup</h3>
                <p>For this project, only a small selection of tools were used. These were:</p>
                <p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Sublime text – My choice of text editor. Within Sublime, I also used plugins to help speed up my workflow.</li>
                    <li>CodePen was used during the beginning of the project. </li>
                    <li>HTML & CSS & JS – The languages used to make this project possible. </li>
                  </ol>
                </p>

                <h3>Location</h3>
                <p>The documentation of my learning was placed on <a href="http://codepen.io/patrickwhitehouse/">CodePen</a>. CodePen was extremely useful for this project as I was able to make changes to the pens and see updates almost instantly. 
                </p>

                <h3>How</h3>
                <p>JavaScript is used on most of the websites serving on the web. JavaScript helps improve user experience by providing features such as animations. Recent trends such as responsive hamburger menus usually rely heavily on JavaScript. Quite a lot of developers chose to use jQuery rather than Vanilla JavaScript as the code is easier to understand and effects can be achieved with little code in comparison to Vanilla JavaScript.  However, as previously mentioned, it’s a waste of time and bandwidth making the user download the full jQuery library just for them to see a simple fade in animation which can be achieved in both CSS and Vanilla JavsScript. Prior to this project, I had a basic understanding of Vanilla JavaScript thanks to some small projects at university. However, a lot of documentation is located at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">Mozilla's MDN</a> which I found extremely useful.</p>

                <h4>First Iteration</h4>
                <p>The first iteration was to see how easy it was to change a div colour using Vanilla JavaScript. Straight away, I noticed a weakness to Vanilla JavaScript compared to jQuery. In Vanilla JavaScript, you need to store the div in a variable in order to prevent continuously using the lengthy selector:<pre><code>(document.getElementById(‘id’))</code></pre> In jQuery, you can simply grab the ID or class by using: <pre><code>$(‘#div’).</code></pre></p>
                <p data-height="400" data-theme-id="dark" data-slug-hash="oZLJjY" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="patrickwhitehouse" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Javascript project - 1" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/patrickwhitehouse/pen/oZLJjY/">Javascript project - 1</a> by Patrick Whitehouse (<a href="http://codepen.io/patrickwhitehouse">@patrickwhitehouse</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
                <script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

                <h4>Second Iteraiton</h4>
                <p>The second iteration was to demonstrate how to toggle classes on elements. jQuery is often used for this feature when creating responsive navigations for when a hamburger menu needs to appear. I still had to include a ID for the div even though I was toggling classes as I was using: <pre><code>(document.getElementById(‘id’)).</code></pre></p>
                <p data-height="400" data-theme-id="dark" data-slug-hash="OpWVVE" data-default-tab="result" data-user="patrickwhitehouse" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Javascript project - 2" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/patrickwhitehouse/pen/OpWVVE/">Javascript project - 2</a> by Patrick Whitehouse (<a href="http://codepen.io/patrickwhitehouse">@patrickwhitehouse</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
                <script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

                <h4>Third Iteration</h4>
                <p>Once I had figured out how to append classes, I decided to challenge myself. I set myself a task to animate elements once they were visible in the viewport (window). After using <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> for some troubleshooting, I discovered I was able to use document.getElementsByClassName('box'); to retrieve all the items with the class name ‘box’. Unlike the getElementById, it returned the classes in an array format which meant a loop had to be used to apply classes to each box, otherwise, only the first box would have been affected and had the class applied to it. This is where I struggled most. Making an element fade in when it is visible in the viewport is easier said than done in Vanilla JavaScript and for this iteration, I had to settle with making the elements animate once the last paragraph had been scrolled past.
</p>
                <p data-height="400" data-theme-id="dark" data-slug-hash="KWWwGB" data-default-tab="result" data-user="patrickwhitehouse" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="JavaScript animation" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/patrickwhitehouse/pen/KWWwGB/">JavaScript animation</a> by Patrick Whitehouse (<a href="http://codepen.io/patrickwhitehouse">@patrickwhitehouse</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
                <script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

                <h4>Fourth Iteration</h4>
                <p>One of the most common trends on websites is a navigation that becomes fixed once the user has scrolled past it. This was easy to recreate using Vanilla JavaScript. All that was needed was the windows height, the nav and the class I was adding and removing. This is a great example to show when Vanilla JavaScript should be used over jQuery. On my personal portfolio, I am guilty of making the user download jQuery to display similar effects to my navigation bar.  </p>
                <p data-height="400" data-theme-id="dark" data-slug-hash="zZNvop" data-default-tab="result" data-user="patrickwhitehouse" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Javascript project - 3 - Sticky nav" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/patrickwhitehouse/pen/zZNvop/">Javascript project - 3 - Sticky nav</a> by Patrick Whitehouse (<a href="http://codepen.io/patrickwhitehouse">@patrickwhitehouse</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
                <script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

                <h4>Final Iteration</h4>
                <p>All the previous examples have used either getElementById or getElementsByClassName to store the element which I wanted to animate using JavaScript. The downside to this is getElementById doesn’t select all the elements with that ID, just one, and getElementsByClassName returns an array of elements with that class, meaning a loop is needed to execute code. A universal selector that can be used for both classes and ID’s is querySelector, for example querySelector(‘.box’). It can also be used to grab any CSS selector such as a paragraph tag which neither getElementById or getElementsByClassName can do. </p>
                <p data-height="400" data-theme-id="dark" data-slug-hash="LWyxEL" data-default-tab="js,result" data-user="patrickwhitehouse" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Animations with querySelector" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/patrickwhitehouse/pen/LWyxEL/">Animations with querySelector</a> by Patrick Whitehouse (<a href="http://codepen.io/patrickwhitehouse">@patrickwhitehouse</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>

                <h3>Evaluation</h3>
                <p>It’s clear to see why some developers chose to use jQuery over JavaScript, one of the main reasons being due to its simple syntax and understanding. From now on I will try to use Vanilla JavaScript where possible, as almost anything can be achieved by using it. It’s also vital that accessibility is taken into consideration too and to always consider those with poor internet connection speeds. This is only a small amount of what JavaScript can achieve and with websites becoming more and more advance, JavaScript will always play a huge part in allowing them to function. Not only is JavaScript important for promoting user experience, common front end app frameworks are based from JavaScript, including both <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React.js</a> and <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular</a>. There are great resources out there for learning JavaScript and communities for solving problems and providing help.</p>
